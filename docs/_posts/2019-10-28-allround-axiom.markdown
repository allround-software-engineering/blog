## Axioms

1. Correct software behavior is defined by the problem domain. It is a product of arbitrary definition and not of any natural law.
1. Software is correct if and only if it behaves correctly in all permitted input, environment and dependency responses.


## Assumptions

- Humans are the main and primary contributor in software engieering. (true today, but may not be tomorrow)
- Humans have very limited cognative capacity.
- Humans make mistakes.
