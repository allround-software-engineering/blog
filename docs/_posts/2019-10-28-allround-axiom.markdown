## Axioms

1. Correct software behavior is defined by the problem domain. It is a product of arbitrary definition and not of any natural law.
1. Software is correct if and only if it behaves correctly in all permitted input, environment and dependency responses.


## Assumptions

1. Humans are the primary contributor in software engineering. (true today, but may not be tomorrow)
1. Humans have very limited cognitive capacity.
1. Humans make mistakes.
1. The software project being managed is beyond a single human's cognitive capacity to fully understand.
1. We are dealing with real world problems that have finite complexity. (There maybe useful problems that has infinite complexity, but we are not discussing them here.) Complexity can be defined as the minimum size of a program that can exhibit desired behavior. Correct software behavior for these problem, therefore, has finite complexity.
1. We are dealing with real world problem that evolves here (think of the addition of new features). Therefore, the software that reflects these real world problems also needs to evolve.

## Conjectures

1. Software Engineering is about complexity and evolution management within/among human organizations.
1. Human knowledge management is the primary issue in software engineering.
