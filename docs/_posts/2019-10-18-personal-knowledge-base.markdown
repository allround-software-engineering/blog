## Why

I believe we all have this moment: "What did I do about this last time?"

We have so many things going on at work, in life. It is easy to lose threads. We just need to note it down somewhere.

## What

### Phase 1

I will create a command line tool for noting down things in a Git repo.

### Phase 2

I will create another tool or daemon service that will scan the notes and automatically organize the notes.
