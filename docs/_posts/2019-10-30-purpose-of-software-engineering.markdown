## Purpose of Software Engineering
The short answer: "Build More for Less".

The long answer:
Like all engineering, Software Engineering is a methodology to deliver a solution to a problem.

Like all good engineering, Good Software Engineering should deliver a solution that is:
- Good enough for the given problem
- Under given cost constraint

Cost consideration in Software Engineering can come from many places and life cycle of the project:

By Life cycle
- Cost of development
- Cost of operation
- Cost of maintenance

By resource category
- Human resource cost
- Computing cost
- Time/Opportunity cost

```
Side note:

To a for-profit company,
engineering department is usually the "Cost department",
not "Revenue department".

Guess which department gets cut first during a downturn?

## Software Engineering is NOT Programming
Software Engineering is not programming as to orchestration (in the music field) is not playing an instrument.

Programming is about knowing there are N ways to solve a problem.
Software engineering is about considering all factors in a given project settings, and choosing a best way to solve the problem.

## Good Programmer is not necessarily a Good Software Engineer
Good Software Engineer is someone who understand and follows the practices, principles and even rules of a given engineering system, and could contribute under and to such system.

Good programming knowledge definitely helps, but not always required. A Good software engineer does not always know how to solve a problem, but he/she definitely should know where to look for and how to choose from.

## Software Engineering is NOT Computer Science
Both are dealing with the same subject: software running on computer, that's about all the similarity.

Software Engineering is all about delivering solutions under constraints.

Computer Science is about all problems related to software running on computer.

- Define problems
- Design algorithms to solve problems
- Evaluate algorithms
- Limit of algorithms
- ...

How to organize a team to deliver a working solution is very low on Computer Science's priority list (if at all).

## Difference between Software Engineering and Hacking (in its original positive connotation)
Hacking is about solving a problem, maybe in new, clever or faster ways.

Software Engineering is about delivering a good enough solution under constraints.
