# Inductive Bias Net

## Purpose

- Build explicit inductive biases used by different problem set.
- Build a net of the relationship among different problem set's inductive biases
- Standardize problem set
- Make different problem set's data sharable
- Find the minimum viable inductive bias set for certain useful real world problem
